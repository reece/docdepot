DocDepot

DocDepot automatically files PDFs from scientific journals into a
directory structure that is easy to browse.  The intent is to make it easy
for groups to share journal collections.

Determining appropriate metadata for a file is challenging.  For now, no
attempt is made to get metadata from the file contents. 

Architecture:
- The sole entry point is for a user to deposit a PDF in an incoming
  directory
- On invocation, the incoming directory is scanned. Each file is processed
  in turn.
