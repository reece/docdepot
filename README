DocDepot automatically files PDFs from scientific journals into a
directory structure that is easy to browse.  The intent is to make it easy
for groups to share journal collections.

Determining appropriate metadata for a file is challenging.  For now, no
attempt is made to get metadata from the file contents.  Rather, incoming
files must be renamed as <pmid>.pdf.
